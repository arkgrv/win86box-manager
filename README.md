# Win86Box Manager

# 1. Purpose of this project
The purpose of this project is to overcome the lack of updated tools used to manage 86Box Virtual Machines. Previous projects such as WinBox for 86Box are currently available, but not
updated, and not maintained.

# 2. Current state of the project
This project is currently under active development, but it lacks all the features that are needed to be an effectively usable application. The app will evolve in the next few weeks.

# 3. Contribution
Every bit of contribution is appreciated!
